    <h2>Project presentation</h2>
    <p>In order to conclude my engineering studies at the national school of advanced systems and network, ESISAR, I have realized a five-month internship at ATOS Worldgrid.</br>
       In an internet of things and Edge computing environment, the team I had the pleasure of being part of starting the second of March until the 31 of July,
       works on an innovative solution called Atos Codex Smart Edge, that takes the notion of Industrial supervision to a higher level, integrating predictive analysis
       and Edge & Swarm computing, the product allows a full-chain management and supervision, from the lowest level of sensors till the data processing on the cloud. </br></br>

       My internship came to further enrich this solution and test one of the Edge servers Atos created in 2019, the BullSequana Edge, with a LoRaWAN module.
       The goal was setting up a LoraWan Network for temperature transmission, going through the study of the Lora network and its component, finding the corresponding lorawan network server,
       installing it on the BullSequana, then making it into as Rancher module on the platform of Codex Smart Edge.</p>
